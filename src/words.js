            it.`,

  LINE2: `2.) I have been assured that I may withdraw from the study at
  any time without disadvantage or having to give a reason.`,

  LINE3: `3 In giving my consent to participate in this study, I
            understand that voice, video or photo-recording will take
            place and I have been informed of how/whether this recording

            advised to consult my GP and I acknowledge that, following
            discussion, I may be required by the University to withdraw

            light that I may have a pre-existing medical condition that
            may put others at risk, I understand that the University
            will refer me to the appropriate authorities and that I will
            not be allowed to take any further part in the study.`,

  LINE7: `7 I understand that if there is any revelation of unlawful
            activity or any indication of non-medical circumstances that
            would or has put others at risk, the University may refer

  INTRODUCTION: `Thank you for your interest in participating in this survey
                for our research project titled 'Web-based Emotion
                Recognition System for E-Learning Audience Management.' Your
                valuable insights will contribute to enhancing the usability
                and effectiveness of our prototype application.
                
                This questionnaire aims to gather your feedback and opinions
                on your experience with the emotion recognition app during
                e-learning activities. Your honest responses will enable us
                to make informed improvements to the system. Please take a
                few moments to share your thoughts and experiences by
                answering the following questions. Your input is greatly
                appreciated and will have a significant impact on the future

  TITLE: `PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET`,

  INTRODUCTION: `You are being invited to take part in a study. Before you decide
                whether to do so, it is important that you understand the study that
                is being undertaken and what your involvement will include. Please

  PURPOSEOFSTUDY: `The study involves the development and evaluation of an emotion
                    recognition system capable of recognizing and classifying facial
                    expressions/emotions in real-time during e-learning activities. The
                    study aims to gain insights into learners' emotional states during
                    educational activities using facial expressions. By understanding
                    learners' emotional engagement, we seek to enhance e-learning
                    experiences and provide valuable feedback for tailored interventions,
                    ultimately improving learning outcomes.`,
  QUESTION4: `Do I have to take part?`,
  ANSWER4: `It is completely up to you whether or not you decide to take part in
            this study. If you do decide to take part you will be given this
            information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form.
            Agreeing to join the study does not mean that you have to complete it.
            You are free to withdraw at any stage without giving a reason. A
            decision to withdraw at any time, or a decision not to take part at
            all, will not affect any treatment/care that you may receive (should
            this be relevant).`,
  QUESTION5: `Are there any age or other restrictions that may prevent me from
                participating?`,
  ANSWER5: `This study is for individuals who are aged 18 and above and hence not
    suitable for minors.`,
  QUESTION6: `6 How long will my part in the study take?`,
  ANSWER6: `If you decide to take part in this study, you will be involved in it
  for <em>not more than 5 -10 minutes`,
  QUESTION7: `7 What will happen to me if I take part?`,
  ANSWER7: `a short video clip, not longer than 5 minutes, which will be played
            for you to watch. The purpose of the video is to elicit emotions of
            joy, laughter etc. While this video is being watched, the emotion
            recognition system will collect and analyse facial expression data
            through your computer's webcam. The different facial expressions
            predicted by the app will be visible for you to see and decide if it
            matches the actual facial expression/emotion showed by you. After
            the completion of this session, you are free to exit the study as
            your involvement in the study would have been completed. A
            questionnaire with no more than 7-8 questions will be used to
            capture your feedback about using the emotion recognition app.`,
